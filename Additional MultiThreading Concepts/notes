HashMap is a non-threadsafe Map which should not be used by multiple threads.
Hashtable is a thread-safe Map that allows only one thread to execute a read/update operation at a time.
synchronizedMap is a thread-safe wrapper on a Map implementation. It is generated by the Collections.synchronizedMap(Map)  factory method. A synchronizedMap also allows only a single thread to work on the map at a time.
And ConcurrentHashMap is a thread-safe Map with greater flexibility and higher scalability as it uses a special locking mechanism that enables multiple threads to read/update the map concurrently.
